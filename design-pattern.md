# Software Design Patterns

Software design patterns are **proven, reusable solutions to common problems** in software architecture and development.  
They provide a shared vocabulary and best practices for building **maintainable, flexible, and scalable** applications.

## Categories of Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns
Focus on **object creation mechanisms**. They abstract the instantiation process, making systems more flexible in deciding what to create.

- **Singleton** → Ensure a class has only one instance (e.g., configuration, logging).  
- **Factory Method** → Define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
- **Abstract Factory** → Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.  
- **Builder** → Step-by-step creation of complex objects.  
- **Prototype** → Create new objects by cloning existing ones.

### 2. Structural Patterns
Deal with **object composition** and how classes and objects work together to form larger structures.

- **Adapter** → Make incompatible interfaces work together.  
- **Bridge** → Separate abstraction from implementation for independent development.  
- **Composite** → Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly (e.g., UI hierarchies).  
- **Decorator** → Dynamically add responsibilities to objects.  
- **Facade** → Provide a simplified interface to a complex system.  
- **Proxy** → Control access to an object (e.g., lazy loading, security).

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Focus on **object interaction and responsibility delegation**.

- **Observer** → Define a one-to-many dependency (e.g., event listeners).  
- **Strategy** → Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable.  
- **Command** → Encapsulate requests as objects, enabling undo/redo.  
- **State** → Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
- **Mediator** → Reduce coupling by having a mediator handle interactions.  
- **Iterator** → Provide a standard way to access elements of a collection.  
- **Chain of Responsibility** → Pass requests along a chain of handlers.
